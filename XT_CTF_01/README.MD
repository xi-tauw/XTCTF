# Tasks

Here are some ctf-like tasks for solving.

Every zip-file is single task itself. No executable files, no internet services for working.

Quest is multilevel task - password from one level open new task.

I provide SHA1 for flags, so you could do selfcheck. Quest doesn't need hashes - successful extract next task is proof of correctness. Last level archivve contains "congratulation.txt" that means you complete whole quest.
